/** 
 * What are we building? 
 * Let's build a quick page based off of something fun like twitch.tv! 
 *  We will run through some of the base functionality of the channel page so we can gain an understanding of the different organization of components available
 * For a breakdown of the components check out the component.drawio file
 * You will need to install the drawio extension to do so.
